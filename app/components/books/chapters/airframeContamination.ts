    title: "Airframe Contamination",
  questions: [
  {
    "id": 1,
    "question": "After an aircraft has been exposed to severe weather:",
    "options": [
      "snow should be removed but smooth ice may be left.",
      "all snow and ice should be removed.",
      "loose snow may be left but ice must be removed.",
      "providing the contamination is not too thick, it may be left in place."
    ],
    "answer": 1
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "question": "Icing conditions may be encountered in the atmosphere when:",
    "options": [
      "relative humidity is low and temperature rises.",
      "pressure is high and humidity falls.",
      "relative humidity is high and temperature is low.",
      "relative pressure is high and temperature is high."
    ],
    "answer": 2
  },
  {
    "id": 3,
    "question": "Which is an effect of ice, snow or frost formation on an aeroplane?",
    "options": [
      "Increased angle of attack for stalls.",
      "Increased stall speed.",
      "Increased pitch down tendencies.",
      "Decreased speed for stalling."
    ],
    "answer": 1
  },
  {
    "id": 4,
    "question": "Frost covering the upper surface of an aircraft wing will usually cause:",
    "options": [
      "the aircraft to stall at an angle of attack that is lower than normal.",
      "no problems to pilots.",
      "drag factors so large that sufficient speed cannot be obtained for take-off.",
      "the aircraft to stall at an angle of attack that is higher than normal."
    ],
    "answer": 0
  },
  {
    "id": 5,
    "question": "If it is suspected that ice may have formed on the tailplane and longitudinal control difficulties are experienced following flap selection, the prudent action to take would be:",
    "options": [
      "immediately decrease the flap setting.",
      "allow the speed to increase.",
      "select a greater flap deflection because this will increase CLMAX.",
      "reduce the angle of attack."
    ],
    "answer": 0
  },
  {
    "id": 6,
    "question": "When considering in-flight airframe contamination with frost or ice, which of the following statements is correct?",
    "options": [
      "Build-up can be identified by the ice detection equipment fitted to the aircraft.",
      "The pilot can visually identify build-up on the wings, tailplane or flight controls by looking through the flight deck windows; at night by using the ice detection lights.",
      "Visual evidence of the accumulation of airframe icing may not exist.",
      "Due to the high speed of modern aircraft, significant airframe contamination with frost, ice or snow will not occur."
    ],
    "answer": 2
  },
  {
    "id": 7,
    "question": "In the event of an icing-induced wing stall, which of the following indications will reliably be available to the flight crew?\n1. Activation of the stall warning device (horn or stick shaker).\n2. The aircraft pitching nose down.\n3. Loss of elevator effectiveness.\n4. Airframe buffet.\n5. A roll control problem (increasing roll oscillation or violent wing drop).\n6. A high rate of descent.",
    "options": [
      "1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6.",
      "1, 3 and 4.",
      "1, 4 and 6.",
      "5 and 6."
